Bonisagus
=========

A project to facilitate running Ars Magica 5th edition campaigns.

Installing and Running
----------------------
You'll need to have NPM installed to run Bonisagus.

```
npm install
npm start-dev
```

By default, this will launch the app at localhost:5000.

You can find a demonstration Bonisagus server running at http://bonisagus.herokuapp.com/. Bonisagus currently uses browser local storage, so no login is required, though characters will only be accessible on the browser they were created on. However, as this is currently pre-alpha software, it is subject to change without notice, so for now I strongly recommend printing out your character sheets or saving them as PDFs.
